Overview
Shika Wallet is an Offline Crypto Wallet designed to empower the unbanked and underprivileged communities in Africa. It builds credit scores while enabling seamless cross-border payments and cryptocurrency swaps‚Äîall accessible offline through USSD.

This transformative wallet infrastructure makes remittances and exchanges more inclusive and efficient, unlocking financial access for millions.

Key Features
Gasless Offline Transactions
Built using multi-party computation (MPC) and Account Abstraction, Shika Wallet enables offline crypto transactions via USSD without requiring gas fees.

Seamless Crypto Swaps
Users can swap any ERC20 token or Bitcoin without needing internet access, providing flexibility for savings, payments, and investments.

Cross-Border Payments

Send and receive remittances between Africa, Europe, and America.
Localized support for Nigeria to facilitate sending and receiving funds.
Why USSD in Africa?
In Africa, USSD technology is a lifeline for financial services, with high mobile penetration but limited access to smartphones and stable internet. Here‚Äôs some real-world context:

Over 70% of mobile transactions in Africa occur via USSD.
Countries like Ghana, Nigeria, and Kenya heavily rely on USSD for banking, bill payments, and money transfers due to its simplicity and accessibility.
The World Bank reports that 57% of the population in Sub-Saharan Africa remains unbanked, underscoring the need for solutions like Shika Wallet.
